      <h2 class="major"><span>What is an Open Device Lab anyway?</span></h2>

      <p>An open device lab is a collection of mobile phones, tablets
        and other devices that people can use to access the
        Internet. The devices are provided
        by <a href="http://opendevicelab.com/">the community</a>, for
        the community, to help everyone have access to a range of
        devices for testing their websites and apps.</p>

      <h3>Why have it?</h3>

      <p>Testing websites across different platforms and devices helps
        ensure the sites are accessible and functional, no matter how
        people access them. Same goes for testing your app over all
        device and operating system versions. With the growing number
        of devices and form factors, it can be challenging and costly
        to maintain an up-to-date collection for testing. That’s where
        the device lab comes in.</p>

      <h3>Who can use it?</h3>

      <p>The lab is open to anyone who needs it to test their web or
        app projects: developers, startups, students, you name it. All
        you need to do is <a href="#contact" class="scroll">get in
        touch</a> with us and schedule a time to come in.</p>

      <h3>Who’s behind all this?</h3>

        Lab now has a few devices, pair of stands and a laptop to run
        Ghostlab.  Device stand on the left side, with old iPad on it,
        is <a href="http://devicelab.vanamco.com/">http://devicelab.vanamco.com/</a>
        and on the right side, with Lumia 520, Huawei Ascend P6 & Asus
        Nexus 7, is the first prototype of SC5 Device
        Stand&trade;. Laptop in the middle is
        running <a href="http://vanamco.com/ghostlab/">Ghostlab</a>
        proxying a websapp to desktop browser and all the devices. All
        the stuff is hooked to SC5 Device Lab WLAN (that Airport on
        the windowsill) which is dedicated for lab devices and
        visitors.

        Now we are more ready than ever.  But you still have to wait a
        bit for the grand opening ceremony.  Stay tuned.

        Lab space now has the very basic furniture: Table, chairs,
        electricity and open WiFi.  We did a slight pivot with the
        device stands, changed material and design.  That paid back
        and we now have a provider working with first prototypes.
        Really looking forward to see how our super secret (well, not
        for long, I guess) design works in practice.

        SC5 has a new, significantly more roomy, office at Jyväskylä
        in <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lutakko-Neli%C3%B6tori-1.jpg">an
        atmospheric old plywood factory office building</a>.  That
        means we now can have a dedicated space for Open Device Lab
        Jyväskylä.  It turned out not to be all that easy to get a
        carpenter to build device stands.  Lets see how it turns out.
        Do we need to the carpentry ourselves or will something else
        pop up.

        The lab is coming together.  We'll have a lab space in january
        2014.  Now we are sketching device shelfs and figuring out how
        thigs will lay out.  Stay tuned&hellip; And while you wait,
        you might want to check
